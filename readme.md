to install
```
npm install @ionic/app-scripts@latest --save-dev
npm install
```

you can see it runs and loads forms from form.io service
```npm run ionic:serve``` or ```ionic serve```

Two versions of the form: 
first is loaded from form.io

second copy is loading JSON in the form.

Hidden component works when loading from form.io
but not when loading from JSON.
